# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
This a machine learning project which aims to predict if a credit card transaction is fraudulent or not.


## Limitations
The goal of this project was to build a model that has a 95% accuracy score, however, the model from the project has an accuracy score of 91%.
The score could improved if more information was made available about the features as now no features could be removed due to any possible 
multi-collinearity within the features.
